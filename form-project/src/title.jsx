            <p>The ATA Carnet System is a perfect illustration of how close
                co-operation between business and customs can facilitate and
                stimulate international trade. The ATA Carnet operates under
                International Customs Conventions administered by the World
                Customs Organisation. A World ATA Carnet Council manages
                the system in cooperation with the WCO.</p>
